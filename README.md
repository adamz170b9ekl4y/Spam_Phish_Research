<h3>Spam Phish Research Scripts</h1>
A collection of scirpts I wrote while working for the University of Texas San Antonio
Cognative Neuroscience Lab

<h4>Things to know</h4>
These scripts were created for a specific study, and thus are specific to that study.
On the otherhand, the scripts should be general enough to be reused. Not all scripts
I wrote are here.

I assume you aready have and known how to use EEGLAB extention for MATLAB
